#%% No Copy at All

# Simple assignments make no copy of array objects or of their data.
a = np.arange(12)
b = a
print('b is a\n', b is a)

b.shape = 3, 4
print('a.shape\n', a.shape)

# Python passes mutable objects as references, so function calls make no copy.
def f(x):
    print(id(x))
print('id(a)\n',id(a))
print('f(a)\n',f(a))

#%% View or Shallow Copy

# Different array objects can share the same data. The view method creates a new array object that looks at the same data.
c = a.view()
print('c is a\n', c is a)
print('c.base is a\n',c.base is a)
print('c.flags.owndata\n',c.flags.owndata)

c.shape = 2,6
print('a.shape\n',a.shape)
c[0,4] = 1234 # a's data changes
print('a\n',a)

# Slicing an array returns a view of it:
s = a[ : , 1:3] # spaces added for clarity; could also be written "s = a[:,1:3]
s[:] = 10 # # s[:] is a view of s. Note the difference between s=10 and a[:]=10
print('a\n',a)


#%% Deep Copy
d = a.copy() # a new array object with new data is created
print('d is a\n', d is a)
print('d.base is a\n',d.base is a)
d[0,0] = 9999
print('a\n',a)

# Sometimes copy should be called after slicing if the original array is not required anymore. For example, suppose a is a huge intermediate result and the Ô¨Ånal result b only contains a small fraction of a, a deep copy should be made when constructing b with slicing
a = np.arange(int(1e8))
b = a[:100].copy()
del a # the memory of ``a`` can be released

# If b = a[:100] is used instead, a is referenced by b and will persist in memory even if del a is executed.
